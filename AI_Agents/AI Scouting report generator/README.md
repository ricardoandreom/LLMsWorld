# Football Scouting Report Generator

This project is a Python-based tool designed to generate detailed scouting reports for football players using data extracted from FBref. The report includes player statistics, similar players, strengths, weaknesses, and potential assessment, all formatted into a professional-looking HTML document that is then converted into a PDF.

## Features

- **Data Extraction:** Scrapes player data from FBref, including statistics, position, physical attributes, and similar players.
- **AI-Generated Scouting Reports:** Uses OpenAI's GPT model to create a professional scouting report based on the extracted data.
- **PDF Generation:** Converts the generated HTML report into a PDF file for easy sharing and presentation.

## Notes

- Ensure you have an OpenAI API key to generate the scouting report.
- The script relies on accurate HTML parsing; changes to FBref's website structure may require updates to the scraping logic.
